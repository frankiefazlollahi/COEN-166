This project contains the files for a Twitter bot that generates new cocktail recipes based on a dataset I created.
SampleRecipes.txt is the dataset of cocktail recipes that the program uses to make new recipes.
generate_recipes.py is the program that generates new recipes using Markov chains.
generated_recipes.txt is the file that contains the recipes generated by generate_recipes.py
twitter_bot.py is the program that reads from generated_recipes.txt and tweets out a new recipe (Note: I did not upload the file containing the private credentials to the twitter account)
tweet.txt is a file that is used for creating the format of the tweet.
